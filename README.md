## OBTAINING SOLUTIONS TO QUALIFIED DRILLS

Although a bit clunky, I have a way to share solutions to Qualified drills with people who have completed them. So here's how it will work: when you complete a drill, I'm notified by email. After this happens, I will (eventually!) add you to the Github repo that has my solution.

This means that in order to receive solutions, **you must have a Gihub account**. So get on that.

## GETTING A START ON A4

I've already written down a schwack of suggestions: https://github.com/MRU-CSIS-1501/201804.asg.04.documentation#suggestions-for-a-plan-of-attack

Let's get cracking on those together.
